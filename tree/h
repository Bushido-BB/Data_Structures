       intro - introduction to user commands

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Section  1  of  the  manual  describes user commands and tools, for example, file manipulation tools, shells, compilers, web
       browsers, file and image viewers and editors, and so on.

NNOOTTEESS
       Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and as a first approximation all user commands under UNIX work precisely  the  same  under  Linux
       (and FreeBSD and lots of other UNIX-like systems).

       Under Linux, there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done
       without first reading lots of documentation.  The traditional UNIX environment is a CLI (command line interface), where  you
       type commands to tell the computer what to do.  That is faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the commands
       are.  Below a bare minimum, to get started.

   LLooggiinn
       In order to start working, you probably first have to open a session by giving your username and password.  The program  lloo‐‐
       ggiinn(1) now starts a _s_h_e_l_l (command interpreter) for you.  In case of a graphical login, you get a screen with menus or icons
       and a mouse click will start a shell in a window.  See also xxtteerrmm(1).

   TThhee sshheellll
       One types commands to the _s_h_e_l_l, the command interpreter.  It is not built-in, but is just a program and you can change your
       shell.   Everybody  has  her  own  favorite one.  The standard one is called _s_h.  See also aasshh(1), bbaasshh(1), cchhsshh(1), ccsshh(1),
       ddaasshh(1), kksshh(1), zzsshh(1).

       A session might go like:

           knuth login: aaeebb
           Password: ****************

       Here typing Control-D ended the session.

       The $$ here was the command prompt—it is the shell's way of indicating that it is ready for the next command.  The prompt can
       be  customized in lots of ways, and one might include stuff like username, machine name, current directory, time, and so on.
       An assignment PS1="What next, master? " would change the prompt as indicated.

       We see that there are commands _d_a_t_e (that gives date and time), and _c_a_l (that gives a calendar).

       The command _l_s lists the contents of the current directory—it tells you what files you have.  With a _-_l option  it  gives  a
       long  listing,  that  includes  the  owner and size and date of the file, and the permissions people have for reading and/or
       changing the file.  For example, the file "tel" here is 37 bytes long, owned by aeb and the owner can  read  and  write  it,
       others can only read it.  Owner and permissions can be changed by the commands _c_h_o_w_n and _c_h_m_o_d.

       The  command _c_a_t will show the contents of a file.  (The name is from "concatenate and print": all files given as parameters
       are concatenated and sent to "standard output" (see ssttddoouutt(3)), here the terminal screen.)

       The command _c_p (from "copy") will copy a file.

       The command _m_v (from "move"), on the other hand, only renames it.

       The command _d_i_f_f lists the differences between two files.  Here there was no output because there were no differences.

       The command _r_m (from "remove") deletes the file, and be careful! it is gone.  No wastepaper  basket  or  anything.   Deleted
       means lost.

       The command _g_r_e_p (from "g/re/p") finds occurrences of a string in one or more files.  Here it finds Maja's telephone number.

   PPaatthhnnaammeess aanndd tthhee ccuurrrreenntt ddiirreeccttoorryy
       Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy.  Each has a _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e describing the path from the root of the tree (which is
       called _/) to the file.  For example, such a full pathname might be _/_h_o_m_e_/_a_e_b_/_t_e_l.  Always using full pathnames would be  in‐
       convenient,  and  the name of a file in the current directory may be abbreviated by giving only the last component.  That is
       why _/_h_o_m_e_/_a_e_b_/_t_e_l can be abbreviated to _t_e_l when the current directory is _/_h_o_m_e_/_a_e_b.

       The command _p_w_d prints the current directory.

       The command _c_d changes the current directory.

       Try alternatively _c_d and _p_w_d commands and explore _c_d usage: "cd", "cd .", "cd ..", "cd /" and "cd ~".

   DDiirreeccttoorriieess
       The command _m_k_d_i_r makes a new directory.

       The command _r_m_d_i_r removes a directory if it is empty, and complains otherwise.

       The command _f_i_n_d (with a rather baroque syntax) will find files with given name or other properties.  For example,  "find  .
       -name  tel"  would find the file _t_e_l starting in the present directory (which is called _.).  And "find / -name tel" would do
       the same, but starting at the root of the tree.  Large searches on a multi-GB disk will be time-consuming,  and  it  may  be
       better to use llooccaattee(1).

   DDiisskkss aanndd ffiilleessyysstteemmss
       The command _m_o_u_n_t will attach the filesystem found on some disk (or floppy, or CDROM or so) to the big filesystem hierarchy.
       And _u_m_o_u_n_t detaches it again.  The command _d_f will tell you how much of your disk is still free.

   PPrroocceesssseess
       On a UNIX system many user and system processes run simultaneously.  The one you are talking to runs in the _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d,  the
       others  in  the  _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d.  The command _p_s will show you which processes are active and what numbers these processes have.
       The command _k_i_l_l allows you to get rid of them.  Without option this is a friendly request: please go away.  And  "kill  -9"
       followed by the number of the process is an immediate kill.  Foreground processes can often be killed by typing Control-C.

   GGeettttiinngg iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn
       There  are  thousands  of  commands, each with many options.  Traditionally commands are documented on _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s, (like this
       one), so that the command "man kill" will document the use of the command "kill" (and "man man" document the command "man").
       The program _m_a_n sends the text through some _p_a_g_e_r, usually _l_e_s_s.  Hit the space bar to get the next page, hit q to quit.

       In  documentation  it is customary to refer to man pages by giving the name and section number, as in mmaann(1).  Man pages are
       terse, and allow you to find quickly some forgotten detail.  For newcomers an introductory text with more examples  and  ex‐
       planations is useful.

       A lot of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files.  Type "info info" for an introduction on the use of the program _i_n_f_o.

       Special topics are often treated in HOWTOs.  Look in _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_d_o_c_/_h_o_w_t_o_/_e_n and use a browser if you find HTML files there.
